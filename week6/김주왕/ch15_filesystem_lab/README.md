ch15_filesystem_lab

This lab simulates block-device based file allocation strategies:
- contiguous allocation
- linked (chained) allocation
- FAT (table) allocation
- indexed allocation with simulated inode (direct + single indirect)

Run:

```
python3 run_all.py
```

Each lab script contains detailed comments explaining the simulation and assumptions.
